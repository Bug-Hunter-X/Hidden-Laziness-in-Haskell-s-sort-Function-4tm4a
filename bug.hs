```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs
  print ys
```
This code snippet might seem innocuous, but it can hide a subtle bug related to laziness.  The `sort` function in Data.List is lazy, meaning that it doesn't actually sort the list until the result is forced (e.g., printed to the console). If `ys` were used in a computation where its sorted values are never fully consumed, the sorting wouldn't happen and unexpected behavior might arise.  This could lead to performance issues or incorrect results in larger and more complex programs.  The problem isn't immediately obvious because small examples like this one work as expected.
